  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>In June of 1997 the first edition of ECMA-262, "ECMAScript: A general purpose, cross-platform programming language", was published as a standard. Within that document, section "7.4.3 Future Reserved Words" described "The following words are used as keywords in proposed extensions and are therefore reserved to allow for the possibility of future adoption of those extensions." and included the `enum` token.</p>

  <p>Many other languages provide some form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type">"Enumerated Type"</a> (or, enumerator).</p> The enumerator is a data type containing a set of elements. An element is an identifier for a constant value. Each of the enumerator's value will be unique from each other, in this case they are all Symbols. The value does not need to be explicitly assigned, the String Value of the Identifier is used by default.
